# Monster Shop Extensions - Bulk Discount

"Monster Shop" is a fictitious e-commerce platform where users can register to place items into a shopping cart and 'check out'. Users who work for a merchant can mark their items as 'fulfilled'; the last merchant to mark items in an order as 'fulfilled' will be able to get "shipped" by an admin. Each user role will have access to some or all CRUD functionality for application models.

Bulk Discount adds additional functionality to Monster Shop, and allows for a merchant to have discounts. Discounts have a discount percentage, i.e. 20%, and an item quantity, i.e. two or more items. A merchant's discount applies to only items from that merchant, and only once they meet or exceed the quantity requirement.

Only a merchant admin can access a merchant's discounts. Currently the only way to create admin roles is through the backend.

#### General Goals

Merchants add bulk discount rates for all of their inventory. These apply automatically in the shopping cart, and adjust the order_items price upon checkout. My main goals for this project were to further my experience with building a rails application, utilizing Active Record queries, resolving Rails errors, and working with MVC and routing.

I would like to implement, if I had more time:
- Additional styling
- Additional routing and sad path
- Additional cart logic

#### Mod 2 Learning Goals reflected:
- Database relationships and migrations
- Advanced ActiveRecord
- Software Testing
- MVC and Rails development
- Database relationships and migrations
